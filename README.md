# Load Profiling:
# First Load:
# Use JMeter to generate the following Load Profile having two spikes:
- The normal applied load is 60 users with a ramp rate = 1 user/ second and hold time = 600 seconds and a ramp down rate of 1 user/second
- Spike A should be suddenly starting by adding 60 additional users to the system while it is under load, the spike should start 120 seconds after the test start, with a ramp rate of 10 users/seconds and a ramp down rate of 10 users/seconds.
- Spike B should similar to Spike A with the exception that it should be applied 360 seconds after the test start.
